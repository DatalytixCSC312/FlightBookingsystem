# FlightBookingsystem
 Design and implement a computer application or app to deal with a single day's administration of
online bookings for flights on an aircraft for a certain period (e.g. for a week).
Each day there are three separate flights: a morning flight at 9am, a midday flight at 12h00 and another evening flight at 7pm.
The application should be able to handle the bookings and cancellations of seats for any of these flights for the period. 
In addition, a management summary (report option) of the total number of seats sold (and vacant) for each flight should be included.
